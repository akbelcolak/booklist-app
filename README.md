javascript3-week3 homework

1. section is until 9.20 in the viedo.

How am I gonna learn those inner-css codes?
and I am not sure if it is easier or not.
I learned the shortcuts for writing id and classes.

2. section 'book class' until 12th minute.

Good to see how to write a simple class.

3. section 'UI class' until 18th minute.

I need to understand why are we using static functions rather than normal function.

4. section event-display and event add-a-book until 25th minute.

I had no diffuculty in this section.

5. section event-remove until 31th minute.

See how to find actual target you want to work with
and we made event propagation where we targeted actual list and then inside static function we said if it contains delete remove whatever we clicked.

6. section validation and alerts until 41th minute:

This section was by far the coolest! to see where to use setTimeOut is also so nice.

   - show alert
     Danger Alert
   - show success message
     Success Alert
   - show remove message
     Info Alert
7. section store-class untill 47th minute.
8. section delete the hard code and add book to UI.
